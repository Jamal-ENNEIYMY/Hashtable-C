An implementation of hashtable in C.

## How to use

after compiling, run the test of your choice,

```

## How to edit
clone the repository to your device by
```bash
git clone https://github.com/er-Bot/Hashtable-C.git
```

make some modifications

show changes using 
```bash
git status
```
first time running these almost all files with changes are showen red as they aren't added yet, we can add them using
```bash
git add filename [filename...]
```
btw make sure to add only important files!!!
now we need to commit those changes:
```bash
git commit -m "a kinda not important message"
```
and thus all changes are commited and the repository is updated, u can check this by the `git status`. However, we still have to upload them:
```bash
git push
```
enter your user name and password. et voilaa, all done.
